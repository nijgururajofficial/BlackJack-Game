# BlackJack-Game
My first big project in python- BlackJack Game
Blackjack (formerly Black Jack and Vingt-Un) is a casino banking game.[1]: 342  The most widely played casino banking game in the world, it uses decks of 52 cards and descends from a global family of casino banking games known as Twenty-One. This family of card games also includes the British game of Pontoon and the European game, Vingt-et-Un. Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.

## Rules for BlackJack House
The deck is unlimited in size.<br/>
There are no jokers.<br/>
The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.<br/>
The the Ace can count as 11 or 1.<br/>
Use the following list as the deck of cards:<br/>
```python
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
```
The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.<br/>
Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
